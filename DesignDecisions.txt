1. Picked std::deque<uint8_t> for the parserâ€™s internal buffer since it provided quick push and pop [O(1)],
random access iteration in constant time.
2. VdpParser Class: Main parsing engine with thread-safe buffer management
3. Frame Structure: Fixed format with start/end bytes, length-based framing
4. Response Handling: ACK/NAK processing with timeout management
5. Buffer Management: Persistent deque for handling partial frames across boundaries

Key Design Patterns:
* State Machine: Frame parsing with resynchronization
* Callback Pattern: Response handlers for asynchronous processing
* Producer-Consumer: Feed data in, extract frames out
* Thread Safety: Mutex-protected operations

Data Flow:
1. Raw bytes â†’ feed() â†’ Internal buffer
2. Buffer â†’ extractFrames() â†’ Parsed frames
3. Frames â†’ Response matching â†’ Callback execution
4. Timeout checking â†’ Cleanup of expired requests



1. Transport Interface (
transport_interface.h
)
Purpose: Abstract the underlying communication layer

ITransport
 interface for different transport types (CAN, DoIP, Bluetooth, Serial, Mock)
TransportFactory
 for creating transport instances
Clean separation between protocol logic and hardware communication
2. Protocol Engine (
protocol_engine.h
)
Purpose: Implement VDP protocol logic on top of the transport layer

ProtocolEngineBase
: Abstract base class with shared functionality
VDPEngine
: VDP-specific implementation with request/response matching, timeouts
Template method pattern for easy extension to other protocols (UDS, etc.)
3. Mobile Bridge Implementation (
mobile_bridge_impl.h
)
Purpose: Bridge between existing mobile interface and new architecture

MobileBridgeImpl
: Implements the existing mobile_bridge.h::IProtocolEngine
MockTransport
: Test transport for hardware-free testing
Thread-safe operations for mobile platform requirements
100% backward compatibility with existing mobile code
4. Comprehensive Test Suite (
test_protocol_engine.cpp
)
Purpose: Ensure reliability and maintainability

Unit tests for each layer independently
Integration tests for full stack
Thread safety tests for concurrent operations
Mock transport testing without hardware dependencies
5. Architecture Documentation (
ARCHITECTURE.md
)
Purpose: Document design decisions and usage patterns

Complete architecture overview with diagrams
Design principles and benefits explanation
Usage examples and implementation guidance
Why This Architecture Was Designed
Problem Analysis
Looking at your architecture diagram and
mobile_bridge.h
, I identified several gaps:

Missing Layers: The current
VdpParser
 was just the parsing component, but lacked the protocol engine and transport abstraction layers shown in your diagram.
Tight Coupling: No clear separation between parsing, protocol logic, and transport mechanisms.
Limited Testability: Difficult to test without actual hardware.
Mobile Integration: The existing
mobile_bridge.h
 needed a proper implementation that could leverage the new architecture.
Design Benefits
1. Separation of Concerns
Transport Layer    â†’ Hardware communication (CAN, Bluetooth, etc.)
Parser Layer       â†’ Frame parsing and validation
Protocol Layer     â†’ VDP-specific logic (timeouts, ACK/NAK)
Bridge Layer       â†’ Mobile platform integration
2. Enhanced Testability
cpp
// Easy to test with mock transport - no hardware needed
auto engine = std::make_unique<VDPEngine>(
    std::make_unique<MockTransport>()
);
3. Maintainability
Clear interfaces: Each layer has well-defined responsibilities
Minimal coupling: Easy to modify individual components
Extensible: Simple to add new protocols or transports
4. Mobile Platform Compatibility
cpp
// Existing mobile code works unchanged
auto* engine = createProtocolEngine();
engine->initialize("/dev/ttyUSB0");
Response response = engine->sendFrame(frame, 1000);
Key Architectural Decisions
Dependency Injection: Transport is injected into protocol engine for flexibility
Template Method Pattern: Base class handles common logic, subclasses implement protocol-specific behavior
Factory Pattern: Clean creation of transport instances
Thread Safety: All operations protected for mobile platform requirements
Backward Compatibility: Existing
mobile_bridge.h
 interface preserved
Real-World Benefits
iOS/Android teams: Continue using existing interface without changes
Testing teams: Can test without hardware using mock transport
Protocol teams: Easy to add UDS, J1939, or other protocols
Hardware teams: Can implement new transports (WiFi, USB, etc.) easily
Maintenance: Clear boundaries make debugging and updates simpler

This architecture transforms the current single-file parser into a robust, enterprise-grade diagnostic protocol framework while maintaining complete compatibility with your existing mobile platform code.


Mobile Bridge Review Summary

ðŸš¨ Current Issues Identified
1. ABI Instability
STL Types: std::vector, std::string, std::function have different ABIs across compilers/platforms
Template Dependencies: Complex template instantiations vary between toolchains
Standard Library Versions: Different libstdc++/libc++ implementations
2. Exception Safety
No Exception Specification: C++ exceptions don't cross language boundaries safely
Mobile Platform Risk: Swift/Java/JNI can't handle C++ exceptions properly
3. Threading Ambiguity
Unclear Thread Safety: No guarantees specified for concurrent access
Callback Thread Context: Unclear which thread callbacks execute on
ðŸ’¡ Three Key Enhancements for Cross-Platform Stability
Enhancement 1: C-Compatible Data Types (
mobile_bridge_v2.h
)
Problem Solved: ABI instability across platforms

Key Improvements:

c
// âœ… C-compatible structures
typedef struct {
    uint8_t ecu_id;
    uint8_t command;
    uint8_t* data;          // Caller-managed buffer
    size_t data_length;
} CarlyFrameData;

// âœ… Opaque handles instead of C++ objects
typedef struct CarlyProtocolEngine CarlyProtocolEngine;

// âœ… C function pointers instead of std::function
typedef void (*CarlyResponseCallback)(const CarlyResponseData* response, void* user_data);
Benefits:

ABI Stable: Works across all compilers and platforms
Language Agnostic: Easy to bind to Swift, Java, C#, etc.
Memory Controlled: Caller manages buffers, preventing allocation mismatches
Enhancement 2: Exception-Safe Error Handling (
mobile_bridge_safe.h
)
Problem Solved: Exception safety and error propagation

Key Improvements:

cpp
// âœ… Error codes instead of exceptions
enum class ErrorCode {
    SUCCESS = 0,
    ENGINE_NOT_INITIALIZED = 1,
    INVALID_PARAMETER = 2,
    CONNECTION_FAILED = 3,
    SEND_FAILED = 4,
    TIMEOUT_OCCURRED = 5,
    INTERNAL_ERROR = 6
};

// âœ… noexcept guarantees
ErrorCode sendFrame(const Frame& frame, Response& response, uint32_t timeout_ms) noexcept;
Benefits:

No Exception Leakage: Guaranteed safe across language boundaries
Clear Error Handling: Explicit error codes for mobile platforms
Debugging Friendly: Detailed error descriptions with error codes
Enhancement 3: Thread Safety and Platform Abstraction (
mobile_bridge_threadsafe.h
)
Problem Solved: Threading model clarity and platform-specific optimizations

Key Improvements:

c
// âœ… Thread context specification
typedef enum {
    CARLY_THREAD_ANY = 0,       // Can be called from any thread
    CARLY_THREAD_MAIN = 1,      // Must be called from main/UI thread
    CARLY_THREAD_BACKGROUND = 2, // Must be called from background thread
    CARLY_THREAD_CALLBACK = 3   // Called from internal callback thread
} CarlyThreadContext;

// âœ… Callback scheduling control
typedef enum {
    CARLY_CALLBACK_IMMEDIATE = 0,    // Invoke immediately (same thread)
    CARLY_CALLBACK_MAIN_THREAD = 1,  // Schedule on main/UI thread
    CARLY_CALLBACK_BACKGROUND = 2,   // Schedule on background thread
} CarlyCallbackScheduling;

// âœ… Platform-specific optimizations
#ifdef __ANDROID__
int carly_android_send_frame_jni(...);
#endif

#ifdef __APPLE__
void carly_ios_send_frame_swift(..., void (^completion_handler)(...));
#endif
Benefits:

Clear Threading Contract: Explicit thread safety guarantees
Platform Optimized: Native integration with iOS/Android threading models
Callback Control: Predictable callback execution context
Implementation Priority
Start with Enhancement 1 (C-compatible types) - Provides immediate ABI stability
Add Enhancement 2 (Exception safety) - Critical for production reliability
Implement Enhancement 3 (Thread safety) - Enables advanced mobile integration
Migration Strategy
Backward Compatibility: Keep original
mobile_bridge.h
 alongside new versions
Gradual Adoption: Mobile teams can migrate incrementally
Feature Flags: Runtime selection between old and new interfaces
Testing: Comprehensive cross-platform testing with real mobile apps
These enhancements transform the interface from a C++-centric design to a truly cross-platform, mobile-optimized API that maintains stability across different toolchains, platforms, and language bindings.
